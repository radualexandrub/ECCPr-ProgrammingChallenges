# ECCPr-ProgrammingChallenges
This is a compilation of possible solutions to over +70 programming problems - solved as training to pass the Exam for Certification in Programming (ECCPr), held within ETTI, UPB.

All the problems have been solved in Python (version 2.7 and 3.6) in summer 2019, when I've started to learn the Python Programming Language (in other words, some of the solutions may not respect the PEP 8 formatting - Style Guide for Python Code).
